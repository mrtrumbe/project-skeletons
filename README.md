A set of skeletons to make bootstrapping projects easier.

Skeletons are organized by language. Each language can have multiple skeleton flavors (for instance we might have a basic
python skeleton and a python skeleton for django projects). 

To use a skeleton, just copy the flavor directory contents where you'd like to setup a new project. Then see the README 
in the language or flavor directory for additional bootstrapping steps. The goal is to have a single script to call to 
setup your project once the files are copied.
